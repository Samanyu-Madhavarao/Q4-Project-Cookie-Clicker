Confection Clacker is a game where the player has to click a cookie and try managing an empire of cookie generators. The goal of the game is to reach the highest number of
cookies as possible, although there is not a maximum amount.
There are multiple methods given to the player to increase the amount of cookies, including:
- Clicking the cookie
- Buying buildings that passively generate cookies
- Buying upgrades that increase the efficiency of buildings and your cursor
- One "secret" that rewards lots of cookies

## The Cookie

The large cookie on the left is the most important part of the game. The mechanic behind it is very simple. Clicking it will increase you cookie count
by 1. Purchasing the first two upgrades will increase the amount you get from one click to 5 and then 50. Like most buttons, this was done by checking 
if the mouse is held within the coordinates of the cookie sprite to shrink it, and its size is increased when the mouse is released.

## CPS

CPS stands for **Cookies Per Second**, and represents the sum of all passive upgrades that the player has unlocked. To increase CPS, the player must:
- Buy buildings
- Buy Upgrades
- Ascend
- Unlock more achievements
